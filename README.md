# Redux workshop

## Introduction

The goal with this workshop is to write code to make the six tests pass by
writing actions and reducers.

The application will fire up a server for you so you can run your actions from the browser console and inspect the resulting state as you're coding.

## Installation

* Run `npm install`
* Run the tests by running `npm test` (or `npm run test:watch` for rerunning tests when the code changes)
* Make them pass!
